### Hi there, I'm Rutger Meuzelaar ðŸ‘‹
I am currently learning Python! I found out I like to optimize and automate workflows during my bachelors degree. I tried to optimize and automate with Excel at first until some people suggested learning a programming language to me. I have a Bachelor of Science (Commercial Economics). I want to learn more about development as a whole. I really enjoy creating solutions and solving problems for people.
